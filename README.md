## Map
### Overview
- Markers for all Citibike stations are included in the dashboard by plotting the start/end station latitude and longitude.
- The size of the markers are based off of the station activity by counting the number of ride ids at each station.
- The color of the markers are based on the ride duration of each trip. This was calculated based on start/end time of the ride.
- Month filter has been added to the dashboard, but this is unnecessary as this only looks at data from March 2022.
- Sections are not marked by zip code as this information was not included in the dataset.

### Trends
- As expected, stations with the most activity and longest ride durations are located in NYC's most popular areas such as Union Square, Tribeca, Time's Square, and Columbus Circle. 
- Stations with the least activity and lowest ride durations are all located outisde of NYC in the Bronx and Brooklyn. This could mean that these locations are not as bike friendly as NYC or commuters are taking different forms of transportation to work/other social activites.
